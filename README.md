## MEMEMANIA
### Meme stream Application

##### Mememania is a meme streaming application which allows the user to type in their details and the url of the meme image to be posted along with their innovative captions. The users can view the memes posted by them and also the previous memes that had been posted by other users too.

##### FLOWS

* Users will post Memes by providing these inputs:
    - Name of the person posting the meme
    - Caption for the Meme
    - URL of the Meme image

* Users will view the latest 100 memes posted (it can be on the same page or on a separate page).

    - If they post a new meme, that should also get listed. Note that these submitted memes will be shown one below the other.

    - Each meme should display the name of the meme maker, the caption for the meme and the image pulled from the meme URL.

##### PROCESS and REQUIREMENTS:
1. The backend shall be capable of receiving the posted meme inputs from the frontend and store them in a database.

2. The backend shall be capable of fetching the list of memes from the database and send them to the frontend.

3. The interaction between the frontend and backend shall be based on a REST API with support for the below 3 endpoints.

4. Endpoint to send a meme to the backend

        HTTP Method - POST
